        <p><strong>Method</strong></p>
        <ol id="list1">
            <li><p><strong>Heat the spices in oil:</strong> Heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat, then cook the coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala and paprika, stirring often, until fragrant (approximately 2-3 minutes). Let cool completely.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Whisk spices into yogurt, add lemon juice, garlic, salt, ginger:</strong> Whisk the cooled spice-oil mixture into the yogurt, then mix in the lemon juice, garlic, salt and ginger.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Cut deep slashes into chicken, coat with marinade, chill:</strong> Cut deep slashes (to the bone) in 3-4 places on the leg/thigh pieces. Just make 2-3 cuts if you are using separate drumsticks and thighs. Coat the chicken in the marinade, cover and chill for at least an hour (preferably 6 hours), no more than 6 hours.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Prepare grill:</strong> Prepare your grill so that one side is quite hot over direct heat, the other side cooler, not over direct heat. If using charcoal, leave one side of the grill without coals, so you have a hot side and a cooler side. If you are using a gas grill, just turn on one-half of the burners.<br>

Use tongs to wipe the grill grates with a paper towel soaked in vegetable oil.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Shake off excess marinade, place chicken on hot side of grill:</strong> Take the chicken out of the marinade and shake off the excess. You want the chicken coated, but not gloppy.<br>

Put the chicken pieces on the hot side of the grill and cover. Cook 2-3 minutes before checking.
Turn the chicken so it is brown (even a little bit charred) on all sides</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Move to cool side of grill, cover and cook:</strong> Move chicken to the cool side of the grill. Cover and cook for at least 20 minutes, up to 40 minutes (or longer) depending on the size of the chicken and the temperature of the grill. The chicken is done when its juices run clear.<br>

Let it rest for at least 5 minutes before serving. Itâ€™s also great at room temperature or even cold the next day.
Serve with naan and flatbread, or with Bangladeshi style rice, with yogurt-based raita on the side.</p></li>

        <ol id="list2">
            <li><p> First, in order to marinate the chicken, take a large bowl, put Greek yogurt, turmeric, chili powder along with salt as per your taste in a small bowl. Mix it well using a spoon and then, add the chicken thighs in the mixture and rub with this mixture. Keep aside for about 20-30 minutes, so that the yogurt mixture is properly absorbed by the chicken. Also, soak saffron in the milk to make saffron milk and keep aside.</p></li>
            <li><p> In the meanwhile, pour refined oil in a deep-bottomed pan, keeping it on medium flame. Add cumin seeds and green cardamom in it and saute for about 2 minutes. Once done, immediately add the sliced onion and fry for 2-3 minutes straight. Make sure you don't burn it, so when the onion starts to get brown in color, add tomatoes and tomato puree and fry for another 5 minutes.</p></li>
            <li><p> Next, add the slit green chilies to the mixture along with ginger-garlic paste, frying the mixture yet again for a minute. Then, add coriander powder and turn the flame to medium-low while stirring and cooking the masala. Quickly, add the marinated chicken and mix for a while so that the ingredients absorb the juices properly.</p></li>
            <li><p> Turn the flame to medium again and heat-through for about 5-6 minutes only to turn it over to low heat. Cover with a lid and let simmer for 5 minutes. Make sure to keep stirring during the entire process, else the chicken might stick to the bottom, eventually ending up burnt. You can add little water, if you find the consistency too thick.
</p></li>


<li><p> Once done, turn off the flame and add half of the boiled rice in the pan and keep the rest aside until required. Sprinkle milk soaked saffron along with garam masala, mint and coriander leaves. Put the remaining rice over this layer and garnish with the same mentioned four ingredients.
</p></li>
<li><p> Lastly, cover the lid, turn the flame to low medium and let the rice cook for about 5 minutes. Once done, put it off and let the biryani stay covered for about another 10 minutes. Serve hot, along with raita or any chutney of your choice.</p></li>

            <li><p> Start by making the pita bread. In a bowl add the milk and the butter and mix well. Mix in the garlic puree, salt and pepper along with the flour and make into a smooth dough. Knead on your worktop until you have a soft dough. Roll into 4 equal sized pieces. Fold it over like a Cornish pasty and cook for 3 minutes in a large wok or a frying pan on each side with a little olive oil.</p></li>
            <li><p> Chop up the chicken. Place your chicken breasts on a chopping board and spend time removing any fat bits, any bones and cutting it as small as you can. The thinner the chicken slices the better it will taste.</p></li>
            <li><p> Make the chicken doner kebabs. Season from above all the chicken marinade over the sliced chicken breast. Using your hands make sure the chicken is well mixed with the marinade.</p></li>
            <li><p> Cook in the Airfryer via the Airfryer grill pan for 12 minutes at 180c/356f. Toss the chicken with some tongs to make sure it is well cooked after 6 minutes and to make sure it is not stuck to the grill pan.
</p></li>


<li><p> Fill the pitas. Start by adding the chicken to them. Then mix Greek yoghurt with chives and lemon for the sauce on top, followed by salad garnish. Then serve.</p></li>
